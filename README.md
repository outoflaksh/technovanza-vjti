# Technovanza VJTI UI/UX Challenge

## Submission by Lakshya Malik

The challenge required us to create a website for any electronic gadget without using any third-party libraries or frameworks; and so I decided to make a landing page for a mobile device. 

The site is made completely in HTML, CSS & JS and can be accessed [here](https://outoflaksh.github.io/technovanza-vjti).
